## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

This is the Udacity experiment design project. I was interestested in using Starbucks promotion experiment data to:

1. Analyze the results of the experiment and identify the effect of the Treatment on product purchase and Net Incremental Revenue;
2. Build a model to select the best customers to target that maximizes the Incremental Response Rate and Net Incremental Revenue.

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There are two data files used in the notebook. "training.csv" is the file for taining data and "Test.csv" is the file for test data.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code is ....
